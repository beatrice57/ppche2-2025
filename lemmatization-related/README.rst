Lemmatization patch
===================

As of July 2025, a second release of the Penn Parsed Corpora of
Historical English (PPCHE2) is available from the Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC) (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2025T09).  A
lemmatized version of the Early Modern English and Modern British
English subcorpora exists, but is not part of the release.  The "patch"
directory contains a patch with instructions on how to generate the
lemmatized files from the release version of the parsed files.  The
instructions covers the patch process only.  For information about the
lemmatization itself, see the current annotation guidelines
(https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/corpus-ling/annotation-2022; also
at
https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppchecurrent).

Use of the lemmatized versions of the texts in the PPCHE2 generated by
the patch in this directory is governed by the same conditions as the
LDC release itself, namely by the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical
English Second Release Agreement.

========================
Aggregate frequency data
========================

In addition, the "lemma-frequencies" directory provides aggregate lemma
frequencies for each subcorpus, tabulated and sorted as follows:

* By lemma only
* By lemma, then form as it appears in the text
* By form, then lemma

Conventions
-----------

* The column delimiter is (possibly multiple instances of) space.
* Forms are normalized with regard to case, with uppercase letters
  being replaced by and folded in with their lowercase counterparts.
* Forms are also normalized with regard to splitting indicated by "@",
  which is deleted.  See the annotation guidelines
  (<https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppche>) for
  details.
* Apostrophes are not modified.
* Entries are sorted alphabetically.  The files may be sorted by
  frequency in a suitable application or by using the Unix command
  "sort" with suitable switches.
