Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English (PPCHE)
=================================================

The most recent release of the PPCHE
(https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/index-2024.html) is
unfortunately no longer available on github, as my posting on github
infringed on prior distribution rights by the Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC).

I respectfully request those of you who have downloaded the corpora from
github to refrain from distributing them further, and I apologize for
any inconvenience caused by my misunderstanding of the distribution
rights at issue.

As of July 2025, a second edition of PPCHE (PPCHE2) is available from
LDC (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2025T09).

The release contains parsed and POS-tagged versions of PPCHE2's three
subcorpora (Middle English, Early Modern English, and Mddern British
English).  For the last two subcorpora, lemmatized versions of the
parsed texts exist, but they are not part of the release.  The
lemmatization-patch directory of this repository contains scripts with
instructions that allow you to generate lemmatized versions on the basis
of the parsed files in the release.  The instructions cover only the
patching process.  Information about the lemmatization itself is
available at
https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/corpus-ling/annotation-2022/lemmatization.html
(see also
https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppche/blob/main/lemmatization.html).

The use of the lemmatized versions of the texts in the PPCHE2 is
governed by the same conditions as the LDC release itself, namely by the
Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English Second Release Agreement.
