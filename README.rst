Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English (PPCHE) - 2025 release by LDC
========================================================================

The most recent release of the PPCHE
(https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/index-2024.html) is
unfortunately no longer available on github, as my posting on github
infringes on prior distribution rights by the Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC).

As of July 2025, the release is available from LDC
(https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2025T09).

I respectfully request those of you who have downloaded the corpora from
github to refrain from distributing them further, and I apologize for
any inconvenience caused by my misunderstanding of the distribution
rights at issue.
